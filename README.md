# javatuples

This is a fork of [javatuples](https://github.com/javatuples/javatuples) with following improvements/fixes:

 1. Built on Java 8 using Maven 3 with latest plugins
 2. Serialization (with popular libraries such as Jackson etc.) working correctly
 
Even with above improvements, this fork maintains: 

1. No change from original in its interface (your existing code should compile just fine when you upgrade to this)
2. Zero dependency on any library (needs only JDK)
